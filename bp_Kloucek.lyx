 Se zvyšující se prevalencí onemocnění spojených s ledvinami je vylepšení
 procesu hledání vhodných párů dárců a příjemců zásadní pro zmírnění zátěže,
 kterou pro zdravotnický systém představují pacienti se selhávajícími ledvinami.
 Předchozí studie ukázaly, jak mohou metody strojového učení být použity
 pro predikování času přežití po transplantaci ledvin.
 V této studii je pro ohodnocení kompatibility mezi dárci a příjemci použit
 model náhodného přežívacího lesa, který predikuje dobu přežití na základě
 jejich pre-transplantačních metrik.
 Model je také použit pro zkoumání různých faktorů ovlivňujících přežití
 štěpu.
 Součástí studie je také podrobné prozkoumání algoritmů, které stojí za
 modelem náhodného přežívacího lesa, a analýzy přežití, která se běžně využívá
 v medicínském výzkumu.

Abstract:
\emph default
 With the increasing prevalence of kidney-related diseases, the improvement
 of the donor-recipient match-making process becomes crucial for alleviating
 some of the burden placed on the healthcare system by patients with failing
 kidneys.
 Several other studies have already demonstrated how machine learning methods
 could be used for predicting survival time after renal transplantation.
 In this study, the random survival forest model is used to evaluate compatibili
ty between donors and recipients by predicting their survival time based
 on their pre-transplantation metrics.
 The model is then also used to investigate the various factors influencing
 graft survival.
 The study also includes an in-depth examination of the algorithms behind
 the random survival forests model, as well as survival analysis, a field
 of statistics commonly used in medicinal resarch.

Kidney transplantation is the single best treatment for patients with end-stage

 and the best survival rate amongst other possible treatments

 and finding a compatible donor-recipient pair is often a highly time-consuming
 task, which results in patients spending a prolonged time on the waiting
 list for potential transplantation.
 While on the waiting list, patients have to undergo dialysis multiple times
 a week for several hours, which supplements the functions of their failing
 kidneys, which greatly reduces the quality of the patient's life and puts
 an additional burden on the healthcare system due to the high cost and
 resources required for dialysis treatment.
 It is therefore crucial to minimize the time patients spend on the waiting
 list by optimizing the process of finding suitable donor-recipient pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more important than the swiftness of the donor-recipient matchmaking,
 is the quality of the given match, as that plays the most crucial role
 in determining the patient's prospects.
 Currently, only a handful of factors are taken into consideration when
 looking for suitable donor-recipient pair, such as whether they are immunologic
ally compatible, their medical histories and their blood type.
 These methods have been proven succesful at minimizing the risk of an acute
 transplant rejection, however there may be other factors that influence
 the graft's long term performance that are currently unaccounted for.
 Therefore, in order to reduce the ﬂow of people returning to the waiting
 list and to prevent premature deaths because of failed grafts, it is necessary
 to uncover these patterns and take them into account when computing compatibili
ty between potential donors and recipients.
 This is where machine learning can play a crucial role, by analyzing large
 amounts of data and identifying patterns that can help find compatible
 pairs or conversely detect incompatible pairings that would otherwise undergo
 transplantation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research will involve analyzing data on past transplantations from the
 US-based 
\emph on
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
\emph default
 dataset, including information on both living and deceased donors, recipients
 and their post-transplant outcome.
 This data will be used to train and test a machine learning model that
 will evaluate the compatibility between a donor and a recipient by computing
 a risk score based on the patient's predicted survival and hazard functions,
 given that they recieve a graft from that particular donor.
 This score can then be compared in order to select the the most compatible
 donor-recipient pairing.
 In particular, this paper will be focused on the Random Survival Forests
 model which has demonstrated a promising performance in related scientific
 papers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Using ML methods to predict kidney transplant survival"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, the research will also examine the performance of the developed
 models on different population samples within the UNOS dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of this thesis will hopefully provide valuable insights into
 application of machine learning in the field of transplantation medicine.
 If the models developed in this research are found to be effective in predictin
g compatibility, it could lead to a better and more efficient matching of
 donors and recipients, resulting in risk reduction for the transplant patients
 as complications such as graft rejection would be less probable.
 Furthermore, this research will also provide a valuable contribution to
 the broader field of medical research, by demonstrating the potential of
 machine learning in improving the success rate of medical treatments and
 reducing the burden on the healthcare system.

\begin_layout Section
General Overview of Machine Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Machine learning is a rapidly growing field within the larger discipline
 of artificial intelligence.
 It involves developing algorithms and statistical models by enabling computers
 to learn from data without the necessity of explicit programming for their
 learning process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key idea behind machine learning is to create algorithms (models) capable
 of recognizing patterns and relationships within large datasets.
 These models are then utilized to make predictions or decisions using new,
 unseen data that was not part of their training process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, machine learning is a great tool when solving problems that
 would conventionally require an infeasible amount of programming or when
 working with large amounts of data from which one could not easily extract
 information or identify meaningful patterns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Classification of Machine Learning Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Machine learning models can be classified based on several parameters including
 the type of data used in training the models and the way they handle new
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Classification by Data Type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Supervised Learning
\emph default
 is a type of machine learning where models require a labeled dataset for
 their learning, which means that the desired output needs to be provided
 to the computer during the training process along with the data.
 Supervised learning can be further subdivided into 
\emph on
regression
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
classification
\emph default
 tasks based on whether the desired output is a continuous numerical value
 or a discrete one respectively.
 Examples of supervised learning models include: 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
logistic regression
\emph default
, 
\emph on
decision trees
\emph default
, 
\emph on
random forests
\emph default
, 
\emph on
supporting vector machines
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
neural networks
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposite of supervised learning is 
\emph on
unsupervised learning
\emph default
 where models are trained on an unlabeled dataset with the aim of finding
 patterns in the given data or grouping data with similar characteristics.
 An example of unsupervised learning is 
\emph on
clustering
\emph default
 which is used to find groups with shared characteristics, 
\emph on
association
\emph default
 which is used to find relation between the input variables (also called
 predictors) in a given dataset, or 
\emph on
dimensional reduction
\emph default
 which is used to simplify data in order to more easily extract information
 from it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A combination of these, called 
\emph on
semi-supervised learning
\emph default
, uses a combination of both labeled and unlabeled data.
 Typically, an unsupervised machine learning model is used first in order
 group similiar examples and assign the unlabeled data a label based on
 the labeled example they were grouped with.
 Then, a supervised machine learning model is used on this newly labeled
 data.
 However, models using reverse order also exist.
 Using semi-supervised learning is advantageous to using a simple supervised
 machine learning model as it allows working with larger amounts of data
 that would otherwise be unusable because of the lack of labeling, thus
 potentially resulting in higher accuracy of the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reinforcement learning
\emph default
 is a specialized case of semi-supervised learning, where the model is trained
 using feedback from the environment and is often used in cases where no
 labeled data exists or when the labeled dataset does not provide the best
 course of action.
 The learning system (called 
\emph on
agent
\emph default
 in this case) learns by performing actions from which it receives either
 rewards or penalties from the environment and based on these has to develop
 a strategy to maximize rewards (called 
\emph on
policy
\emph default
)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Instance-based vs.
 Model-based
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Instance-based
\emph default
 learning algorithms work by comparing the similarity of new input data
 to the training data, an example of this is the 
\emph on
k-nearest neighbors
\emph default
 algorithm, which finds 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 examples from the training data that have the most similar features to
 the given input and outputs either the most frequent or the average label
 value in this cohort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand 
\emph on
model-based learning
\emph default
 algorithms develop a mathematical function whose parameters are learned
 from the training data and predictions about new data are then obtained
 by providing the newly introduced data as an input to the function.
 model-based learning algorithms are for example 
\emph on
linear regression
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
neural networks
\emph default
.

\begin_layout Section
Building a Machine Learning Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of building a machine learning model generally consists of the
 following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Preprocessing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a machine learning model can even begin to be trained, it is necessary
 that the training data is formatted correctly.
 The process of transforming the dataset into a correct format is called
 
\emph on
preprocessing
\emph default
 and is an integral part of the process of building almost every machine
 learning model.
 Preprocessing includes, but is not limited to, the following techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Imputing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most common challenges tackled during preprocessing is missing
 values.
 Majority of machine learning models are not capable of handling entries
 with missing features so unless there is another model at disposal that
 can handle missing values, the missing values need to handled in one of
 the following ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest option is to drop either the features or the samples containing
 missing values from the dataset.
 This is fast and reliable, however, it is not optimal as it can lead to
 a potential loss of important information that the model could learn from.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A preferable alternative is replacing the missing values based on some given
 rule.
 This process is called 
\emph on
imputing 
\emph default
and can be performed in many different ways.
 One of the most popular imputers is the

 in.
 In the case of categorical features, it replaces missing values with the
 most common category in the particular column.
 Also in the case of both categorical and numerical values, it can simply
 replace the missing values with a given constant value.

Encoding Categorical Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another challenge tackled during preprocessing arises from the fact that
 most machine learning models only allow numerical features as input.
 As a result, categorical values need to be transformed into numerical features
 in a process called 
\emph on
encoding
\emph default
.
 One of the most simple yet most efficient methods of encoding is one-hot
 encoding, which transforms a categorical feature with unique values 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{1},\ldots x$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $_{n})$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 columns as shown in Table

 For each row, let 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 denote the original categorical value, i.e.
 
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\strikeout off
\xout off
\uuline off
\uwave off

\begin_inset Formula $y\in(x_{1},\ldots x_{n})$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$

 denote the value of the encoded column 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\hat{n}$

 Then

Splitting Data into Training, Validation and Test Sets

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of machine learning is to create models that are able to make predictio
ns when faced with new data that the model hasn't seen during the training
 process.
 To achieve this, it is necessary to split the data into 3 parts: 
\emph on
Training set
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Validation set 
\emph default
and
\emph on
 Test set.
 
\emph default
If a model is trained using all available data, it may perform well on said
 data, but may be unable to generalize for new instances thus making it
 useless in practice, which is why it is important to keep some of the data
 aside for validation and testing.
 The datasets used for validation and testing are also referred to as the
 
\emph on
hold-out 
\emph default
sets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is desirable to keep the majority of the data for training with the usual
 distribution being 70% for training and 15% for training and validation
 each, though with larger datasets, it is possible to allocate even higher
 percentage of the data to training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the training of the model has been done using the training set, the
 performance of the model is tested using the test set, i.e.
 data that it hasn't seen before.
 A good metric for measuring the quality of the model is the 
\emph on
generalization error, 
\emph default
given by the error rate of the predictions that the model makes based on
 samples from the hold-out sets, i.e.
 samples it has not seen during the training process.
 Though not all models use generalization error for evaluation, for example,
 models focused on time-to-event predictions are usually evaluated using
 the C-index described in Section

\begin_layout Standard
Better performance of the model can be achieved using a validation set,
 which gives the option to select the best values for the model's 
\emph on
hyperparameters
\emph default
 (specifics of a given machine learning model that are set before the training
 process begins).
 This is done by training the model multiple times on the training set with
 different hyperparameters and then comparing their performance on the validatio
n set.
 Once the best model has been selected, it is then trained using both the
 training and the validation set and its performance is then measured using
 the test set

Evaluating Performance

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the model performs well on the training set (e.g.
 it's generalization error is low), but poorly on the hold-out sets, it
 means that the model has learned unnecessary details (also called 
\emph on
noise
\emph default
) from the training set which then hampers its ability to generalize for
 new instances.
 This phenomena is called 
\emph on
overfitting 
\emph default
and is a common problem that arises during the process of developing a machine
 learning model.
 Overfitting is usually caused either by the data being too noisy (errors
 in the data, many outliers), the dataset being too small, or by having
 too many irrelevant features.
 The above mentioned problems can be overcome by gathering more data, removing
 outliers and locating errors in the data or by simplifying the model by
 choosing fewer features.
 Another way of solving the issue of overfitting is constraining how much
 the model can change the values of its parameters, thus making the model
 simpler and less prone to overfitting.
 This is called 
\emph on
regularization

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Machine learning models can also face the opposite problem, i.e.
 not being able learn the underlying patterns in the training data and thus
 being inaccurate on both the hold-out and training data.
 This is called 
\emph on
underfitting 
\emph default
and can be solved by either using a more appropriate (and more complex)
 model for the given task, selecting better features to train the model
 on or reducing any constraints that might have been set to simplify the
 model in order to prevent overfitting

Gini importance.

\emph default
 For each feature used as an input for a given tree, the MDI is calculated
 as the mean improvement in the accuracy of the given tree when splitting
 on this feature.
 In the case of random forests, this importance is then averaged over all
 trees.
 This is a very efficient way of computing feature importance as it can
 be calculated during the training process.
 However this method can be biased towards overestimating importance of
 variables with bigger scaled values.
 To address this issue, numerical features are often scaled to the

\begin_layout Standard
Decision Trees are a supervised, model-based machine learning method used
 for both regression and classification, whose main benefits are that it
 can handle complex and nonlinear relations in data.
 There are two types of decision trees based on the type of target variable:
 
\emph on
Classification trees 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
Regression trees.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision trees are in practice mostly binary trees where in each parent
 node (also called a 
\emph on
decision node
\emph default
) a set attributes of a feature vector is examined in order to make a split
 based on a given criteria.
 The specifics of this criteria are learned during the training process.
 For example, if a value of the given feature is below a specific threshold,
 the left branch is followed, otherwise the right branch is followed, with
 the threshold being set to maximize a certain performance metric of the
 model.
 Once the leaf node (also called 
\emph on
terminal node
\emph default
) is reached, the example is assigned a probability of belonging to a given
 categorical value in case of a classification tree or assigned a numerical
 value in case of a regression tree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different decision tree algorithms use different split rules also known
 as 
\emph on
criterions.

\emph default
 For example, one of the most common algorithms used for generating a classifica
tion tree is called ID3, which selects what attributes from the feature
 vector to split upon based on 
\emph on
Entropy
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Information gain 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
Gini Impurity
\emph default
 of the subsets created by the split made on each feature.
 In the case of Regression Trees, the criterion used is often based on the
 reduction of 
\emph on
variance
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
standard deviation
\emph default
 between labels and their mean values.
 Another type of criterion is used by the decision trees in Random Survival
 Forests, described in more detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 where

 then the possible threshold values 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$

 For each iteration (ordered pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(j,t_{j}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$

\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the quality of the split is evaluated by using the algorithm's criterion.
 Assuming that the tree's criterion is entropy, the entropy of a given set
 of examples is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 million deaths compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $409,000$

 in 1990.
 Symptoms of CKD include fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, leg swelling
 and itching.
 As the disease progresses, it may result in health complications such as
 anemia, cardiovascular disease, bone disease and nerve damage.
 In the final stages when the kidneys fail altogether, the affected person
 needs to regularly undergo dialysis, which supplements the kidney's functions.
 However, this needs to be done several times a week and each session lasts
 between 3 to 5 hours, which results in a significant decrease in the quality
 of the patients life.
 Thus when possible, transplantation is a much preferred treatment for CKD.

\begin_layout Section
Current Strategies for Assessing Donor-Recipient Compatibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a number of procedures that both the patient and a potential donor
 have to undergo before a transplantation.
 Results of these procedures are then used for assessing the compatibility
 between the patient and the potential donor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, their overall health is checked in order evaluate whether they
 are suitable candidate for the procedure.
 This includes blood tests, imaging studies, and other diagnostic tests
 to check for any underlying health conditions that could affect the success
 of the transplantation such as history of diseases related to the functionality
 of kidneys.
 It also necessary that the donor and the recipients have compatible blood
 types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, a process called 
\emph on
HLA typing 
\emph default
is performed both on the patient and the potential donor.
 HLA typing assumes paramount importance in determining the immunological
 compatibility between the donor and the recipient, which is necessary for
 a successful transplantation.
 Transplantation between an immunologically incompatible paring could lead
 to an acute transplant rejection, which happens when the recipient's immune
 system perceives the graft as foreign and rejects it.

\begin_layout Subsection
HLA Typing 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\begin_layout Standard
The process of HLA typing involves testing the person's blood and tissue
 to determine their 
\emph on
human leukocyte antigen
\emph default
 (HLA) type, which is a protein that plays a key role in the body's immune
 response.
 Incompatible pairs are discarded while potentially compatible pairs have
 their blood tested against each other in a laboratory using a process called
 
\emph on
cross-matching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Cross-matching
\emph default
 involves testing the blood of the potential donor against the blood of
 the recipient to ensure that there are no antibodies that could cause a
 reaction.
 If the recipient's serum contains antibodies that react with the donor's
 cells, the complement will be activated and will cause the cells to burst,
 or lyse.
 This reaction can be seen under a microscope, and the degree of lysis can
 be graded to determine the strength of the reaction.
 When no reaction occurs, the cross-match is called 
\emph on
negative
\emph default
, whereas if a reaction occurs, the cross-match is called 
\emph on
positive.
 
\emph default
A positive cross-match does not automatically mean that the transplantation
 cannot proceed though, as a successful transplantation may still be possible
 if the reaction is not too severe, given that the patient is in favorable
 health condition and that they are given additional treatment with immunosuppre
ssive drugs that suppress the activity of the immune system.
 This is often the case when other donors are not easily available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision on which pairings to discard and which ones to to perform a
 cross-match on is done by calculating a 
\emph on

 These classes are then further subdivided into loci ( a locus denotes a
 specific position on a chromosome): HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C in the case
 of HLA class I and HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP in the case of HLA class II.
 Each locus is further divided into alleles (an allele represents specific
 DNA sequences at a given locus): HLA-B27, HLA-DRB101, and so on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kidney transplantation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Each locus has two alleles, one from each parent.
 When calculating the HLA mismatch, a score is given based on the number
 of allele mismatches for each subclass (HLA-A, HLA-DR, etc.).
 A higher score indicates a greater degree of immunological incompatibility
 in the pairing..
 The relationship between HLA mismatches and allograft survival time has
 been revealed thanks to the UNOS data, that will be used later 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the UNOS dataset, only the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR loci are being
 used for computing mismatch.
 As illustrated in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:HLA-Mismatch"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, a mismatch is calculated for each locus (A, B, DR) by counting how many
 of the two antigens are different between the donor and the recipient.
 The overall HLA mismatch is then given by the sum of these locus mismatches.
 Note that D- represents donor's typing while R- represents recipient's
 typing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, in the first row of the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:HLA-Mismatch"

\end_inset

, the HLA mismatch is 5 since the both of the alleles at the HLA-B and HLA-DR
 locus differ, therefore, the HLA mismatch at the locus level is 2 for the
 HLA-B and HLA-DR loci.
 At the HLA-A locus, both the donor and the recipient have one identical
 allele (2) therefore, the mismatch at the HLA-A locus is only 1.
 In total, the HLA mismatch is

Goals

\begin_layout Standard
The aforementioned procedures have been very successful at reducing the
 risk of graft failure shortly after the transplantation.
 In recent years, improvements in these techniques have successfully minimized
 the risk of an acute transplantation rejection within the first year of
 the transplantation below

.
 Nevertheless, it may be possible that there are yet undiscovered correlations
 effecting the long-term performance of the graft, that are not being accounted
 for in the current donor-recipient matchmaking process.
 The progress that has been made in the field of transplantation medicine
 has also resulted in the abundance of data about both pre-transplant conditions
 as well as patient follow-up.
 This presents an opportunity for the use of machine learning techniques,
 aimed at uncovering these correlations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the majority of well-documented data originates from the last
 30 years, which is significantly shorter than the average human lifespan,
 solely considering patients whose grafts have already failed would introduce
 a bias towards individuals who had a lower probability of survival from
 the outset.
 Therefore, it is necessary to include all patients in the analysis, including
 those with still functioning grafts as well as those lost to follow-up
 (i.e.
 the status of their graft is unknown).
 The difficulty lies in the fact that conventional machine learning models
 do not inherently handle this type of data when considering the patient's
 survival time as the target variable.
 However, there exists a field of statistics that addresses these challenges
 called 
\emph on
survival analysis
\emph default
.

Survival Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction to Survival Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survival analysis is a collection of statistical procedures for data analysis,
 for which the outcome variable of interest is time until an event occurs,
 usually referred to as 
\emph on
time-to-event 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
survival time.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 More specifically, time-to-event refers to the time from the beginning
 of a follow-up, i.e.
 the period during which the subject of a study is observed, usually from
 the date of diagnosis, the start of a treatment or a transplantation, until
 the occurrence of an event of interest, usually meaning the death of a
 patient, disease incidence, relapse from remission, recovery or in the
 case of kidney transplantation: 
\emph on
graft failure
\emph default
.
 Survival analysis is not limited to medical applications, as it is often
 used, for instance, to model reliability in engineering, i.e.
 to study the time until a failure of mechanical system occurs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survival analysis involves several statistical techniques that are commonly
 used in medicinal research, namely the 
\emph on
Kaplan-Meier estimator
\emph default
, the 
\emph on
Log-Rank test 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
Cox proportional hazards model
\emph default
 just to name a few.
 These will be explained in detail further in this chapter, with the former
 two also being a vital part of the algorithm behind random survival forests

Data Censoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crucial challenge that all survival analysis methods have to tackle is
 
\emph on
data censoring
\emph default
, which refers to the lack of data about the exact survival time of an individua
l, which happens, for example, as a result of a study ending before the
 said individual experiences an event or if the individual withdraws from
 the study.
 This kind of censoring is called 
\emph on
right censoring, 
\emph default
meaning that if the survival time were to be plotted along a horizontal
 axis, the event would happen to the right side of the cutoff point of the
 study, but it is unknown by how much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Left censored 
\emph default
data are also possible, but they are uncommon in the case of post-transplantatio
n data as the the date of transplantation is naturally almost always known.
 Left censoring can happen, for example, in the case of predicting the survival
 time after exposure to a virus, as the exact date of this occurrence is
 often unknown.

The two fundamental functions of survival analysis are the

denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $S(t)$

 and the 
\emph on
hazard function,

also called the 
\emph on

\emph default
denoted by 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $h(t)$

\emph default
The survival function describes the probability of an individual 
\emph on
surviving
\emph default
 (i.e.
 not experiencing an event) longer, than a specified point in time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 In another words, it is defined as

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S(t)=\Pr(T>t)

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is a random variable describing the survival time of an individual.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, the hazard function, as hinted by its alternative name, gives
 the the instantaneous potential per unit time (usually days) for the event
 to occur, given that the individual has survived up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, that is, the hazard function is focused on 
\emph on

 event occurring) compared to the survival function which is focused on
 
\emph on
not failing 
\emph default
(i.e.
 surviving)

 What is meant by the word 
\emph on
potential

, is the probability of an event happening within a given time frame and
 as this this potential is 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
While the survival functions may seem to be obvious option for describing
 models aimed at predicting survival time, it is usually the hazard function,

 Importantly, either of the functions can be derived from the other one
 using one of the following formulae

Hazard Ratio

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most common goals of survival analysis is to describe a correlation
 between a given 
\emph on
exposure variable
\emph default
 ( i.e.
 a feature of an instance in the data) and the 
\emph on
outcome variable
\emph default
 (e.g.
 survival time).
 This relationship is described using the 
\emph on
hazard ratio
\emph default
 (HR), which describes the relative risk of an event occurring in one group
 compared to another, i.e.
 it is calculated as the ratio of the hazard functions of two groups
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{HR}(t)=\frac{h_{1}(t)}{h_{2}(t)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hazard ratio of 1, means that the probability of an event occurring at
 a given time is the same in both groups.
 If, for example, said groups are sorted by the value of a certain exposure
 variable and their hazard ratio is 1, this means that there is no relationship
 between said exposure variable and the outcome variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analogously, a hazard ratio of 5 would mean that the first group has a five
 times larger hazard than the second group

\begin_inset Formula $\forall t_{j}\in\tau$

 the probability of an individual surviving past

\begin_inset Formula $j=1,\ldots,|\tau|$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Pr(T>t_{j}\mid T\geq t_{j})=1-\frac{f_{j}}{r_{j}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note that the number of individuals at risk does not take in account the
 individuals that were previously censored, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{j}=r_{j-1}-f_{j-1}-c_{j-1}$

\emph on
Cox regression
\emph default
, also referred to as the

Cox proportional hazards model
\emph default
, is a mathematical model used for analysis of time-to-event data.
 Specifically, it is used to model an individual's hazard function based
 on a set of given predictor variables 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 It is commonly used in medical research to investigate the factors that
 influence the duration until an event occurs.
 For example, it can be used to predict survival curves of patients who
 have undergone kidney transplantation and for identifying factors that
 impact the likelihood of graft failure.
 The Cox regression model will also be used later as a benchmark to compare
 the performance of the machine learning model to a conventional survival
 analysis model.

\begin_layout Standard
The general formula of the Cox regression model describes the hazard function
 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h(t,\mathbf{X})=h_{0}(t)\exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_{i}X_{i}\right)\label{eq: Cox regression}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}=\left(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots X_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 predictor variables, 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t,\mathbf{X})$
\end_inset

 represents the hazard function at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and given predictor variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X},$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $h_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 is an unspecified 
\emph on
baseline hazard function
\emph default
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\left(\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\ldots,\beta_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 represent constant coefficients associated with corresponding predictor
 variables.
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{0}$
\end_inset

 is unspecified, makes Cox regression a semi-parametric model (in contrast
 to parametric models, whose functional form is known) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Parametric models are more precise when fitted correctly, however it may
 not always be clear which parametric model is appropriate for a given problem.
 As a result, a semi-parametric model is a great tool when uncertain about
 which parametric model to use, as a semi-parametric model will typically
 approximate the results of the correct parametric model

To measure the effect of a particular predictor variable on the overall

As described in Section

 The estimation of the hazard ratio is therefore given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 denote the sets of predictors of two different individuals.
 The ratio is commonly written so that the higher-valued hazard is in the

 This ensures that the ratio is always greater than

 By using (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula

meaning that the hazard ratio stays constant over time, i.e.
 the hazards are

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The estimated hazard ratio for the predictor variable

which allows it to handle issues commonly associated with conventional survival

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) can be interpreted as the probability
 that a given model will rank a random positive example more highly (e.g.
 it will assign a higher probability of being positive) than a random negative

 The AUC, as well as the C-index, can attain values from 0 to 1, where 1
 means a perfect model whose predictions are always correct and 0 being
 the opposite.
 A random classifier that assigns the predicted value with a uniform distributio
n, will have an AUC of 0.5.
 Generally, models with an AUC above 0.7 are considered to be good predictors.
 An example of a machine learning models that use the AUC for evaluation

The survival SVM differs from the regular SVM in the sense that it uses
 survival time as well as censoring status as labels and uses both of these
 to calculate the hyperplane.
 The survival SVM can work with two types of problems: a regression problem
 which outputs predicted survival time, and a ranking problem which ranks
 individuals based on their survival time.
 This is however slightly disadvantageous as these types of predictions
 are not easily transferable to standard survival analysis outputs, namely
 the survival and hazard functions

 lungs, liver, pancreas and intestines.
 As a result, UNOS maintains a large database of organ transplantations
 carried out between 1984 and 2022.
 Specifically, there are more than a million entries regarding kidney transplant
ations, an amount sufficient for training a machine learning model.

 This facilitates easier analysis of results and makes information extraction
 more efficient.
 This proves to be beneficial especially in the fields of data analysis

 Jupyter Notebooks are primarily used for executing Python code.
 Nonetheless, as indicated by its name, Jupyter Notebooks also provide support

Cluster Computing

Due to the large size of the tables extracted from the UNOS dataset, reaching

 needed to be first loaded into main memory, which is far beyond the capacity
 of regular computers.
 As a result, all computing was conducted remotely on the HELIOS high-performanc
e computing cluster hosted at the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of
 Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech Technical University in
 Prague.
 The cluster can provide up to 384GB of main memory on a single node, which
 was a sufficient for the needs of this project.
 The connection to the cluster was established using SSH in the Linux shell.
 To enhance practicality, remote nodes were forwarded onto localhost, which
 allowed working with Jupyter notebooks directly via a web browser on a

The Kidney_Pancreas table also happens to be the largest in terms of file
 size.
 After converting the table to JSON format, the resulting file size reached
 to approximately 40GB.
 Consequently, loading the file into a Pandas DataFrame took a significant
 amount of time.
 Therefore, it proved advantageous to convert all tables from JSON to .csv
 format, which drastically reduced loading time.
 This efficiency can be attributed to the fact that unlike JSON, which stores
 data in a hierarchical structure using key-value pairs, the .csv format
 stores data in a tabular (and therefore faster to read from) format.

 columns, the survival times computed and predicted in the following sections
 and chapters describe the survival time of the graft itself, not necessarily
 the survival time of the patient, as the graft may fail but the patient
 may continue to live on either by returning to dialysis or by getting another
 transplant.
 Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, the survival time of the graft
 will sometimes be referred to as the patient's or recipient's survival
 time.

\begin_layout Standard
As the original

 table also contained some information about donors, duplicate columns were
 created upon merging with the

 Some were easy to identify as they shared the same name, while others had
 to be identified manually.

Irrelevant Columns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The STAR dictionary was also used to identify obviously irrelevant features
 and drop them to speed up the training process.
 These include IDs, codes and form statuses used internally by either UNOS
 or individual transplant centers.

As mentioned above, the

 table itself contains limited information about both deceased and living
 donors.
 Therefore, columns regarding deceased donors had to be dropped from the
 dataset used for training of the model for living donors

.
 and vice versa
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This was done excluding columns with high percentage of missing values
 (
\begin_inset Formula $>50\%$
\end_inset

) as the columns regarding deceased donors would be left unfilled in the
 case of grafts from living donors.

The opposite case was handled in the same fashion accordingly.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Low Quality Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dropping columns with high percentage of missing values was also done to
 prevent a significant loss of information by having to either impute large
 amounts of missing values or discarding entries with missing features.
 Columns with only one unique value were dropped as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
HLA typing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As illustrated in the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "HLA mismatch table"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, each locus of both the donor and the recipient has two columns.
 These columns are categorical and represent different alleles.
 The number of unique alleles exceeds 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

 in some cases.
 This would create a problem when encoding categorical columns as it would
 create an enormous amount of new columns.
 Fortunately, these columns can be dropped from the dataset as they are
 already used for calculating HLA mismatch and therefore dropping them does
 not result in a significant loss of information.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ensuring Correct Formatting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon loading the dataset into a DataFrame, many of the columns had incorrect
 data types.
 Specifically there were two issues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Categorical variables that were described using digits were incorrectly
 classified as numerical.
 This would lead to misleading results and had to be dealt with by identifying
 these columns using the STAR dictionary and changing their data type to
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
object
\end_layout

\end_inset

 so that they could be encoded later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Columns containing dates were formatted as strings and were thus identified
 as categorical.
 This would lead to problems when encoding since there would be a new column
 created for every unique time.
 This was dealt with by only using the year and setting its datatype to

Feature Encoding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RSF model requires all input variables to be numerical.
 However, many of the features in the dataset were categorical and therefore
 had to be encoded before they could be used for training the RSF model.
 Scikit-learn's OneHotEncoder was used to encode the categorical variables.
 Encoding the whole

In order to simplify the model and improve its performance, the best features
 were selected by calculating their importance using permutation importance
 described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Permutation-Variable-Importance"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In comparison to variable importance calculated by the Gini importance
 (described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Feature-Selection"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), computing permutation importance is a highly time consuming, as well
 as resource demanding task.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scikit-learn's implementation of permutation importance allows computing
 of permutation importance to be done in parallel on multiple cores.
 However, due to the specifics of the implementation of random survival
 forests in the scikit-survival's package, this was extremely memory demanding
 and couldn't be completed even using the Helios cluster.
 Therefore, the computations were performed using only a single core which
 resulted in computation times of up to 10 hours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scikit-learn's implementation of permutation importance offers a 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
n_repeats
\end_layout

\end_inset

 parameter, which controls the number of times a feature is permutated in
 the dataset resulting in increased accuracy of the feature importance by
 reducing randomness.
 However, this also greatly increases the computational complexity.
 Thus, the variable importances were computed initially on a smaller dataset
 created by dropping all entries with missing features, with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
n_repeats=5
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This was followed by a computation on a larger dataset with imputed missing
 values with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
n_repeats=2
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 The two resulting tables of variable importances were used to create a
 list of the 27 most important features.
 The variable importance of those features was then validated by computing
 permutation importance on a dataset consisting only of these features with
 
\begin_inset Flex Code

Model's Capabilities

Once trained, the model can be used to predict allograft's survival as well
 as cumulative hazard functions based on information about the recipient
 and the donor as listed in Table

 In addition, the model can also be used to predict a risk score 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, which is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{n\left(h\right)}H\left(T_{j}\mid\mathbf{x}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is an input feature vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the terminal node that was reached when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 was introduced, 
\begin_inset Formula $n\left(h\right)$
\end_inset

 is the number of unique event times in node

Model's Limitation

\begin_layout Standard
With increasing time, the predicted survival curves eventually flatten,
 which is an inaccuracy of the model as survival curves cannot stay constant
 forever and must eventually decline to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plateauing of both of the curves is caused by the fact that the limited
 amount of samples belonging to the individual terminal nodes of the survival
 trees.
 More specifically, this is caused by the high amount of censoring in the
 dataset (
\begin_inset Formula $55\%$
\end_inset

 in the complete 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 in the

\end_inset

 dataset), which results in situations where there are many censored individuals
 belonging to a terminal node, whose time of censoring is greater than the
 last unique event time.
 Consequently, the survival functions, computed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator
 in each survival tree, have a constant nonzero value past the last unique
 event time.

The accuracy of the model given by the C-index is lower than the one developed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Using ML methods to predict kidney transplant survival"

\end_inset

 which had a C-index of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.724$
\end_inset

.
 This is because they used predictors that are unknown prior to the transplantat
ion itself.
 One such example is the 
\emph on
cold ischemia time
\emph default
, which describes the time the graft spends outside the body of both the
 donor and recipient.
 This feature in particular has a significant impact on the recipient's
 survival prospects, thus giving their model a significant boost in accuracy.
 However, as mentioned before, the goal of this paper is to develop a machine
 learning model that can be used for computing compatibility in order to
 match the suitable pairs of recipients and donors and therefore should
 only use information that is knows prior to the transplantation.
 Thus, the model developed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, while more accurate in predicting survival time, is not suitable for such
 a task.

As can be seen in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Variable-Importance"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the age of the recipient is by far the biggest factor influencing the
 graft's survival time.
 This is not surprising, as this is the case with most other medical conditions.
 The impact of the recipient's age on survival time can also be validated
 using the Kaplan-Meier estimator (described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Kaplan-Meier-Estimator"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: KM_age"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, survival curves were computed by selecting 1000 random samples from the
 test for each age group 0-14, 15-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+.
 Next, survival curves of these cohorts were computed with the Kaplan-Meier
 estimator using observed survival time and censoring status.

From observation, age exhibits little influence on the graft's survival
 in the age groups 0-59 and only begins to have a significant impact in
 the 60+ age cohort.
 This trend can also be observed on the predictions made by the RSF model.

Another feature with a significant variable importance is HLA mismatch (describe
d in Section

reference "HLA mismatch"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 By grouping samples by the level of their HLA mismatch and computing their
 survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
 It can be observed in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: KM_HLA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that recipients with zero HLA mismatches have more optimistic survival
 curves than others.
 It can also be observed that survival curves of recipients with few (but
 more than one) mismatches do not differ significantly from the survival
 curves of recipients with higher mismatch levels.
 It is also important to note that the distance between the survival curves
 of patients with some HLA mismatches and the ones without, seems to grow
 larger with time suggesting that HLA mismatch level is important not only
 for preventing acute rejections, but also for long term survival.

\begin_layout Standard
The Cox Regression model (described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Cox-Regression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) fitted onto the same dataset had a C-index of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.619$
\end_inset

, meaning that the random forests model clearly outperforms Cox regression
 when making predictions based on the features listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Variable-Importance"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.Though it is important to note, that the Cox regression model took a significant
ly less amount of time to fit and had considerably lesser memory requirements
 in comparison to the RSF model.
 This prompts the question as to whether such added computational complexity
 is worth the improved accuracy.

 categories representing the recipient's and the donor's ethnic categories
 respectively.
 Within the UNOS dataset, individuals are divided into 7 categories: White,
 Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander and Multiracial.
 Consequently, the dataset was divided into 49 subsets.
 To ensure adequate sample sizes were, only 10 subsets with the most entries
 were selected for further investigation.
 The selected subsets are listed in Table

Plotting the calculated Kaplan-Meier survival curves on a graph (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Kaplan-Meier-survival-curves-by-eth"

\end_inset

) reveals that there are slight differences between the particular groups.
 Namely, pairings where at least one from the donor-recipient pairing was
 Asian, had more favorable survival curve.
 On the other hand, pairings where either the donor or the recipient were
 Black, had a slightly less favorable survival curve than the others.

This is even more visible when focusing only on the pairings where the recipient
 was white (see Figure

 in general perform no worse or better than transplantations between the

\begin_layout Section
Usage for Computing Compatibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RSF model could be used in cases where there is one patient looking
 for a donor and multiple donors are available.
 The model would then be used to asses their compatibility by calculating
 the risk score of each of the possible pairings and the the pairing with
 the lowest risk score would be chosen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following is an example of how the model could be used for computing compatibili
ty and thus assist in the decision-making process of choosing the best donor-rec
ipient paring: Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Patient-Information"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 contains information about the patient, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Donor-information"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 contains information about 5 possible donors along with a risk score predicted
 by the RSF model if the donor's kidney was to be selected for the transplantati
on.
 The donor-recipient pairing with the lowest rick score would be selected
 for transplantation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, a situation for which the model might not be suited for
 is a case where there are multiple patients and one (or more) donor(s).
 If the model were to be used to find the best match in this scenario, the
 model would tend to select the youngest patient and discriminate against
 older patients as the recipient's age is the most important feature influencing
 the graft's survival time as shown in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Important-Features"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This however, could result in cases where a donor could be the best possible
 match for an older recipient by all other measures but the age, while for
 the younger patients, even better suited match might be found in the near
 future, however the model would still rank the younger patient as the best
 match solely because of his age.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking age out of the equation would not be a good solution as that would
 seriously damper the models accuracy.
 There also might be important correlations between age and other features.
 Preferably, the resulting risk score could be weighted based on the recipients
 age, e.g.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 were to denote the resulting compatibility, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 the risk score predicted by the RSF model, 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 the weight and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 the pairing's feature vector, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
C\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=w\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\cdot R\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\label{eq:age_weighted}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 could, for example, be defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\left(\frac{x^{(AGE)}}{c}\right)^{-1}\label{eq:weight}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{(AGE)}$
\end_inset

 is the recipient's age variable of the feature vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 could be a constant such as the 
\emph on
life expectancy
\emph default
 in the given region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: KM_age"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the recipient's age only begins to play a factor in the 
\begin_inset Formula $60+$
\end_inset

 age group.
 Therefore, using the formula suggested in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:age_weighted"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) may put younger patients at a disadvantage, when compared to middle-aged
 patients.
 Consequently, an alternative solution could be to subtract a certain amount
 from the risk score of patients belonging to the 
\begin_inset Formula $60+$
\end_inset

 age cohort.
 Using the same symbols as before, the the compatibility could be given
 by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
C\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\begin{cases}
R\left(\mathbf{x}\right) & \textrm{if }x^{(AGE)}<60\\
R\left(\mathbf{x}\right)-c & \textrm{else}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 could be the difference between the average risk in the 
\begin_inset Formula $0-59$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $60$
\end_inset

 age cohorts.
 The average risk score of both of the cohorts was calculated by sampling
 1000 samples from each of the cohort, calculating a risk score for each
 of the samples and finally taking their averages.
 The resulting difference in average risk scores was
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c=\hat{R}_{0-59}-\hat{R}_{60+}=2269
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{n}$
\end_inset

 represent the average risk score of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 age cohort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Possibilities for Future Research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In spite of the RSF model's demonstrated superiority in accuracy in comparison
 to the Cox Regression method, which is commonly used for kidney transplant
 survival estimation, the C-index value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.638$
\end_inset

 indicates that the model is still far from being a reliable predictor.
 Therefore, a future research could focus on enhancing the model's accuracy
 by altering the model's algorithm or by working with higher quality data.
 For example, the UNOS dataset contains detailed medical information obtained
 at the time of transplantation along with abundant follow-up data.
 However, for the purposes of this study, a more expansive dataset regarding
 the pre-transplantation state of both the donor and the recipient would
 be advantageous.
 Consequently, a potential future research could entail gathering of such
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, it can also be expected, that future models will naturally
 improve their prediction accuracy due to the availability of larger quantities
 of non-censored as well as high-quality data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, it may prove worthwhile to adapt the model for scenarios involving
 multiple donors and recipients, extending beyond the suggestions outlined
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

The increasing prevalence of the end-stage kidney renal disease imposes
 a great strain on the healthcare system.
 With the demand for kidneys greatly exceeding the supply, patients have
 to undergo months, sometimes even years of dialysis waiting list.
 Consequently, effective matchmaking of recipient parings is of the utmost
 importance, not only to ensure that people don't return to the waiting
 list but, even more importantly, to prevent premature deaths.
 Finding pairings that will ensure the longest possible survival time is
 crucial for achieving this goal.
 This however, is no easy task as there are complex factors affecting the
 compatibility of donors and patients, many of which may be currently unaccounte
d for.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Machine learning demonstrates a promising solution to this problem.
 The random forests model, a machine learning model that builds on the foundatio
n of survival analysis, outperforms the conventionally used Cox proportional
 hazards model in predicting survival time.
 Machine learning models like these have the ability to evaluate the quality
 of a potential match based on predicted survival time, and could thus be
 used as a part of the decision-making process of choosing the the optimal
 donor-recipient pairing.
 As demonstrated, these models could also serve as a tool for examining
 the influence of various factors on the outcome of renal transplantations,
 both short-term and long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although further research is required to improve the model's reliability
 to a level suitable for clinical adoption, the model even in its premature
 stages is still able to reveal insights into the determinants impacting
 graft survival following renal transplantations.
