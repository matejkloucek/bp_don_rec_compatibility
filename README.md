# Estimating Kidney Transplantation Donor-Recipient Compatibility Using Machine Learning
This repository accompanies a bachelor's degree project focused on the use of machine learning for predicting 
compatibility between potential donor-recipient pairings for kidney transplantation.

## Thesis

The thesis itself can be found in the  [bp_Kloucek](bp_Kloucek.pdf) file. It contains the results generated by 
the Jupyter notebooks found in this repository. It also contains an in-depth look at
the algorithms used in the study, as well as machine learning and survival analysis as a whole. 

## Code

The code used for this project is separated into two Jupyter notebooks:

- `Preprocessing_Feature_Selection.ipynb`: Contains code used for data preprocessing and feature selection.
- `Final_RSF_Model.ipynb`: Contains code used for hyperparameter tuning, training of the final model and generating graphs used in the study.


## Usage

1. The study is based on data provided by UNOS. Information on how to obtain and format the data can be found in the fifth chapter of the thesis.
2. Assuming you have python and pip installed, dependencies can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
    ```
3. The `Preprocessing_Feature_Selection.ipynb` needs to be run first as it generates a file that is then used in `Final_RSF_Model.ipynb`
